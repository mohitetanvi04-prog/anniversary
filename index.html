  <h2>A letter for you</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>
    I don’t really know when it happened. Somewhere between our talks,
    the silences, and the normal days, you started to matter to me more
    than I expected. There was no big moment or clear beginning.
    It just grew quietly. Being with you never felt like work.
    It felt easy, and it felt right.
  </p>

  <p>
    With you, I learned that love doesn’t have to be loud or dramatic.
    It can be calm. It can be patient. You made me feel safe —
    not in a perfect way, but in a real way. Safe to be myself.
    Safe to feel things without explaining too much. Safe to grow
    at my own pace.
  </p>

  <p>
    This year wasn’t perfect. We learned, adjusted, and tried again.
    But we stayed. And somewhere along the way, you became home to me —
    not a place, just a feeling I carry without thinking.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for staying. For your effort. For your presence.
    For being real.
  </p>

  <p class="sign">
    Still choosing you.<br>
    Even on the ordinary days.<br><br>
    — Tanvi
