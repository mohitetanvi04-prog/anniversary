    <h2>For You</h2>
    <hr>

    <p>
      Somewhere between our conversations, silences, and ordinary days,
      you quietly became important to me.
    </p>

    <p>
      There wasn’t a loud beginning or a sudden moment.
      It just happened — slowly, naturally.
      Being with you never felt forced. It felt easy.
    </p>

    <p>
      With you, I learned that love doesn’t always have to be intense or dramatic.
      Sometimes, it’s calm.
      Sometimes, it’s just knowing someone is there.
    </p>

    <p>
      You made me feel safe — safe to be myself, safe to feel, safe to grow.
      You were my comfort on days when my mind felt heavy,
      and my calm when things felt overwhelming.
    </p>

    <p>
      This year wasn’t about perfection.
      We learned, we adjusted, and we chose each other through it all.
      And somewhere along the way, you became home —
      not a place, but a feeling.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for staying.
      Thank you for being patient, kind, and consistent.
    </p>

    <p>
      Still choosing you.<br>
      Even on the ordinary days.
    </p>
